<h1>OGC CDB (Common DataBase)</h1>
<p>This driver provides support for reading and writing CDB datastores. While the goal of this driver is to allow access without detailed knowledge of the CDB file structure, CDB is the organziation of specific datasets used in modelling and simulation applications, so the user will need some familarity with the concepts outlined in the CDB specification.</p>
<p>The driver can facilitate reading and writing support CDB raster and vector datasets. The driver will also support a <em>basic</em> method of inserting existing OpenFlight models into the CDB dataset. Given the difference between how GDAL works with raster and vector data, these datasets will be described separately.</p>
<h2>General Implementation Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>When reading from CDB datastores, the driver will respect CDB versions that are linked through Version.xml files. When writing to CDB datastores, the path specified as the dataset name will be the CDB version written to, regardless if the specified path is linked to other versions.</li>
<li>Although a single driver is used to facilitate raster and vector access, because of how GDAL is designed, GDAL raster commands (gdal*) can only recognize raster datasets, and GDAL vector commands (ogr*) can only recognize vector datasets, even if they reside in the same CDB datastore.</li>
<li>The CDB GDAL driver does not enforce or validate vector feature attribution. It is the responsibility of application creating the data, or passing it through the CDB GDAL driver, to ensure that attribution is compliant with CDB specification. The driver will set the default schema for a layer to include mandatory and optional attributes, but it will not enforce that the calling application supplies appropriate values. <em>(The only exception is with respect to the MODL and MODT attributes when inserting models into the CDB using point features)</em></li>
<li>Opening a CDB will be a time-consuming process, because the driver will iterate through all the CDB datasets to determine the coverage for that CDB. The driver is able to save these index files for later access, which will greatly improve the time when subsequently opening the same CDB. These files are only generated (and utilized) if the "CDB_IndexPath" configuration variable is set to the absolute path of where to write these files. An index file is generated for each CDB version in a chained CDB. The name of each file will be hashed from the path for the particular CDB version. This data should be updated if the CDB driver writes to the CDB version, but it can be manually regenerated by specifying the given config option when using a GDAL commandline utility:<br />&nbsp;
<pre>--config CDB_REBUILD_DRIVER_INDEX YES</pre>
</li>
<li>By default, the driver will attempt to load configuration variables from the file "cdb_config.xml" at startup, found in the path referenced by the environment variable "GDAL_DATA".</li>
<li>The CDB feature data dictionary,&nbsp; contained in the file "cdb_fdd.xml" needs to exist in the directory pointed to be the environment variable "GDAL_DATA".</li>
</ul>
<h2>Vector Datasets</h2>
<p>Since CDB datastores have well-defined datasets rather than arbitrary data, a convention will be used where specific layer names will be used to reference associated CDB datasets (refer to <a title="Supported Vector Layers" href="#supported_vector_layers">"Supported Vector Layers"</a> table.) Note that the driver can recognize datasets in existing CDB datastores that may not be listed in this table, but reading or writing to these layers will fail.</p>
<h3>Implementation Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Since a CDB datastore may be comprised of hundreds or thousands of individual vector files, it is not possible for the driver to know (or even estimate) the number of features contained in a dataset. As such, random-access methods that rely on this functionality, including <em>OGRLayer::GetFeatureCount()</em> and <em>OGRLayer::GetFeature()</em> are not supported. Use sequential reading methods such as <em>OGRLayer::GetNextFeature()</em> instead.</li>
<li>Performance will be greatly improved if features are accessed through small geographical areas by using <em>OGRLayer::SetSpatialFilterRect()</em>.</li>
<li>The attribute schema (layer definition) for a vector layer can only be modified when the layer is created, and only before features are added. It is not possible to modify the attribute schema for an existing layer.</li>
<li>When writing features to a CDB datastore, the driver will handle splitting CDB tiles into finer LODs if feaure limits are reached in those tiles. However, networked vector datasets (such as RoadNetwork_Road_Linears) do not currently generate new SJID/EJID point attributes for the finer tiles.</li>

<h2>Raster Datasets</h2>
<p>Raster CDB datasets are referenced as subdatasets through GDAL. The supported CDB datasets, along with their GDAL subdataset name, are listed in the <a title="Supported Raster Subdatasets" href="#supported_raster_layers">Supported Raster Subdatasets</a> table. Note that the driver can recognize datasets in existing CDB datastores that may not be listed in this table, but reading or writing to these subdatasets will fail.</p>
<p>The resolution of the raster is data is based on the finest LOD for the particular CDB dataset (unless overridden with the CDB_LOD_MAX configuration option or environment variable). If coarser LOD data exists, it will be accessible through overviews to the rasterband of the base image. It is <strong>strongly</strong> recommended that that overviews be utilized if coarser data is acceptable, due to the high cost of working with fine LODs.</p>
<h3>Implementation Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Raster images are aligned to CDB geocell boundaries.</li>
<li>Currently, overviews are only available if coarser LOD data exists for the CDB dataset.</li>
<li>The resolution of the subdataset image is based on the finest LOD found for the dataset as well as the area of coverage. At CDB LOD 0, this would be an image that is 1024 pixels times the number of geocells wide/high. The resolutions doubles in each dimension with each higher LOD. For a CDB with wide coverage and fine-resolution imagery, this will likely result in a base image that is unworkably large.</li>
<li><em><strong>USE OVERVIEWS WHEN YOU CAN</strong></em><strong>, </strong>and if that isn't possible, try to only access blocks of interest using low-level block reads or small areas using <em>RasterIO()</em> calls.</li>
<li>If you know directly what the finest level of LOD data you need to work with, specifying that level with the "CDB_LOD_MAX" config option could be easier to work with than overviews.</li>
<li>If you know ahead of time you only need to work with a smaller geographic area, you can consider utilizng the CDB_ConstrainAOI and CDB_AOI config options to specify the extents to work with. If these are set, the driver will behave as though this is the only coverage in CDB. This will result in a smaller base-image resolution.</li>

<h2>Model Geometry and Texture Datasets</h2>
<p>CDB model datasets do not fit into the GDAL architecture, so support for CDB models is a bit unorthodox. The CDB GDAL driver does have basic support for inserting OpenFlight models into CDB. This is possible using the following methodology:</p>
<p>With regard to CDB, models are ultimately a geometrical representation of an object at a location specified by a geospecific or geotypical point feature. With the CDB GDAL driver, models are placed into the datastore by inserting point features that are attributed with <strong>MODL</strong> and <strong>MODT</strong> attributes.</p>
<p>Within the CDB GDAL driver, model support is handled indirectly. Models can be inserted into a specified CDB datastore using the following procedure:</p>
<h4>Through the API</h4>
<ol>
<li>Configure <strong>MODSRC</strong> and <strong>TEXSRC</strong> variables (environment variables or using <em>CPLSetConfigOption()</em> function) to point to the paths where source models and textures (respectively) are stored.</li>
<li>Open the CDB store for updating, specifying vector access (or if it doesn't exist, create a new datastore).</li>
<li>Get a layer using the appropriate layer name from <a title="Supported Model Layers" href="#supported_model_layers">"Supported Model Layers"</a> table (or create one, if it doesn't exist).</li>
<li>Create point features, ensuring that <strong>MODL</strong> attribute is specified for the filename of the model (not including the path), and <strong>MODT</strong> attribute is either "T" (geo'T'ypical) or "S" (geo'S'pecific) model. (Ensure that the MODT value matches the model layer you are writing to.)</li>
<li>Texture data will be inserted based on texture references in the models that are inserted.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Commandline</h4>
<ol>
<li>Start with point features stored in a GDAL-supported vector format. These features should have <strong>MODL&nbsp;</strong>attributes refering to the model filename, and&nbsp;<strong>MODT&nbsp;</strong>attributes specifying either&nbsp;"T" (geo'T'ypical) or "S" (geo'S'pecific) models. The points should indicate the position of the models.</li>
<li>Configure <strong>MODSRC</strong> and <strong>TEXSRC</strong> variables (environment variables or using <em>"--config"</em> command line argument) to point to the paths where source models and textures (respectively) are stored.</li>
<li>Specify the destination layer name using the appropriate layer name from <a title="Supported Model Layers" href="#supported_model_layers">"Supported Model Layers"</a> table.</li>
<li>Use the point feature vector file as input, and specify the CDB as output, writing to the destination layer name in the previous step.</li>
<li>See the end <a title="usage examples" href="#command_line_usage">usage examples</a> for an example of this.</li>

<h2>Virtual Datasets</h2>
<p>The preceding sections describe the native CDB datasets that are exposed as GDAL vector layers and raster datasets. The are currently a few other types of non-native data that can be synthesized by the driver based on CDB data. Virtual datasets are only visible in the layer list if the CDB_VIRTUAL_DATASETS option is enabled prior to opening the CDB with the driver (the exception is coverage data, which is specified with a different option).</p>
<h3>Footprints</h3>
<p>The "GSFeature_Manmade_Footprints" vector layer is generated by building top-view polygon outlines of the models referenced by MODT and MODL attributes in manmade geospecific point features. This depends on appropriate attribution and the existance of the model files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Coverage</h3>
<p><em>(This is enabled by the "CDB_COVERAGE" configuration parameter). </em>With this function, new vector layers will be available for reading - one per vector layer or raster subdataset. In each layer, there will be a polygon feature per CDB geotile file found in that dataset. Each polygon feature will have attributes that describe the CDB version, base filename, and LOD. For vector datasets, the name of the coverage layers will be the same as the base dataset with "_COVERAGE" appended to the name. For raster subdatasets, the name will be the subdataset tag plus "_COVERAGE". (For example, for the CDB:H:\CDB\Yemen:Imagery_Yearly subraster, the corresponding coverage layername would be "Imagery_Yearly_COVERAGE".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<h3>Configuration Parameters</h3>
<p><em>(these may be set in environment variables, or in the cdb_config.xml file found in GDAL_DATA directory)</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CDB_SINGLE=</strong>YES: Do not follow linked CDB versions, but rather treat the passed CDB path as an unlinked, individual CDB.</li>
<li><strong>CDB_ConstrainAOI=</strong>YES/NO: If "YES", behave as though the CDB only contains data with the extent specified by CDB_AOI configuration parameter.</li>
<li><strong>CDB_AOI=</strong><em>&lt;north,south,east,west&gt;:</em> This defines the geographic area to constrain CDB processing if CDB_ConstrainAOI configuration parameter is "YES".</li>
<li><strong>CDB_LOD_MIN</strong>=<em>&lt;lod from -10 to 23&gt;</em>: When writing vector features, this will be the CDB LOD level where features will start to be added. The default is LOD level 0. Note that higher LODs may be generated if the number of features per tile exceeds CDB limits.</li>
<li><strong>CDB_LOD_MAX</strong>=<em>&lt;lod from -10 to 23&gt;</em>: When reading raster dataset, this will be the finest LOD level that is considered for the data subdataset. (The apparently resolution of the base subdataset is based on the finest LOD read.) If this is not specified, the finest LOD level will be used.</li>
<li><strong>CDB_REBUILD_DRIVER_INDEX</strong>=YES/NO: If "YES", the internal index file for each CDB version in the datastore will be regenerated. Use this option only after careful consideration, as this process can take a long time. This option should be used if a CDB datastore has been updated by other tools.</li>
<li><strong>CDB_IGNORE_INDEX</strong>=YES/NO: If "YES", the driver will not utilize previously-generated coverage index for reading the CDB, forcing the driver to iterate over the entire CDB. An index file may have incomplete coverage, if it was generated when options such as CDB_LOD_MAX or CDB_ConstainAOI were used when it was generated. This CDB_IGNORE_INDEX option can be used to assure that the complete and most up-to-date data is being used, at the cost of having to iterate over the entire CDB. If this is specified, the previous index will <em>not </em>be overwritten. (A more practical option would be to use the CDB_REBUILD_DRIVER_INDEX option to regenerate the index, so at least subsequent access will be faster).</li>
<li><strong>CDB_INSERT_MODELS</strong>=YES/NO: To be used when writing point features, if YES, the driver will also insert models into the appropriate CDB dataset based on <em>MODL</em> and <em>MODT</em> feature attributes. This requires that <strong>MODSRC</strong> and <strong>TEXSRC</strong> options also be specified.</li>
<li><strong>MODSRC</strong>=<em>&lt;path_to_models&gt;</em>: This specifies a path to the directory which contains the source models that will be inserted into the CDB datastore if writing model layers. This must be used in conjunction with the TEXSRC parameter.</li>
<li><strong>TEXSRC</strong>=<em>&lt;path_to_models&gt;</em>: This specifies a path to the directory which contains the textures for&nbsp; models that will be inserted into the CDB datastore if writing model layers. This must be used in conjunction with the MODSRC parameter.</li>
<li><strong>CDB_COVERAGE=</strong>YES/NO: If "YES", enables a number of extra vector layers. Each of these layers represents the coverage of CDB data for the corresponding layer or subdataset. (For example, the "Imagery_Yearly_COVERAGE" layer represents the coverage of the Imagery_Yearly raster subdataset). In these coverage layers, there will be one polygon feature per geotile that exists in the underlying data. Each polygon will have attribution that describes the file and LOD it represents.</li>
<li><strong>CDB_VIRTUAL_DATASETS=</strong>YES/NO: If "YES", enable non-CDB datasets created by the driver to be available. Currently, the only virtual dataset is the GSFeature_Manmade_Footprints layer.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The following options are intended specifically for use with interactive operations:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CDB_DYNAMIC_LOD</strong>=YES: If this is specified when reading vector features, the driver will adjust which CDB LOD data is referenced based on the size of the spatial filter currently in use. This is intended only for use with interactive applications for visualizing CDB data, because the finest features of a dataset may not be accessible, depending on the size of the spatial window used to request the features. This mode is enabled by default if the driver detects it is being called from QGIS.</li>
<li><strong>CDB_GEOTILE_RASTER_CACHE_SIZE</strong>=<em>&lt;number of tiles to cache&gt;</em>: This is intended for use with interactive applications thatare likely to request the same raster blocks more than once. If this is set, CDB geotiles will be stored into a memory cache, which may increase the speed at which GDAL raster blocks are repeatedly referenced. This has no value for operations where pixels are only read once. A geotile consists of a block no larger than 3 megabytes (1024x1024 pixels x 3 bands), so you can budget accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>CDB_CACHED_OVERVIEW_FILE</strong>=<em>&lt;path to imagery file&gt;: </em>For the Imagery_Yearly raster subdataset, it is possible to substitute a single pregenerated imagery file to be returned in place of overviews for overviews representing CDB LOD levels below a given threshhold. This will <em>greatly</em> improve the speed of data accessed from imagery overviews, since a native CDB overview still needs to access one imagery geotile per geocell, which can be very expensive over a world view. If the specified file is not found, the driver will revert to the normal overview method.</li>
<li><strong>CDB_CACHED_OVERVIEW_LOD=</strong><em>&lt;lod from -10 to 23&gt;: </em>This is the finest level CDB LOD level where the file specified by CDB_CACHED_OVERVIEW_FILE will replace overviews.</li>
<li><strong>CDB_RasterWatermark=</strong>YES/NO: If "YES", raster tiles will be watermarked with information describing the CDB where the tile was found, the CDB LOD of the data, and Uref/Rref values.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Layer Creation Options</h3>
<h3>Dataset Open Options</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>CDB_LOD_MAX</strong>=<em>&lt;lod from -10 to 23&gt;</em>: When reading raster dataset, this will be the finest LOD level that is considered for the data subdataset. (The apparently resolution of the base subdataset is based on the finest LOD read.) If this is not specified, the finest LOD level will be used.</li>
