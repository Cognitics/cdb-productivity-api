/*! \brief Node

The Node interface is the primary datatype for the entire Document Object Model.
It represents a single node in the document tree.
While all objects implementing the Node interface expose methods for dealing with children, not all objects implementing the Node interface may have children.
For example, Text nodes may not have children, and adding children to such nodes results in a DOMException being raised.

The attributes nodeName, nodeValue and attributes are included as a mechanism to get at node information without casting down to the specific derived interface.
In cases where there is no obvious mapping of these attributes for a specific nodeType (e.g. nodeValue for an Element or attributes for a Comment), this returns null.
Note that the specialized interfaces may contain additional and more convenient mechanisms to get and set the relevant information.

Cloning an EntityReference automatically constructs its subtree if a corresponding Entity is available, no matter whether this is a deep clone or not.

This method tests for equality of nodes, not sameness (i.e. whether the two nodes are references to the same object) which can be tested with Node::isSameNode().
All nodes that are the same will also be equal, though the reverse may not be true.

Two nodes are equal if and only if the following conditions are satisfied:
\li The two nodes are of the same type.
\li The following string attributes are equal: nodeName, localName, namespaceURI, prefix, nodeValue.
This is: they are both null, or they have the same length and are character for character identical.
\li The attributes NamedNodeMaps are equal.
This is: they are both null, or they have the same length and for each node that exists in one map there is a node that exists in the other map and is equal, although not necessarily at the same index.
\li The childNodes NodeLists are equal.
This is: they are both null, or they have the same length and contain equal nodes at the same index.
Note that normalization can affect equality; to avoid this, nodes should be normalized before being compared.

For two DocumentType nodes to be equal, the following conditions must also be satisfied:
\li The following string attributes are equal: publicId, systemId, internalSubset.
\li The entities NamedNodeMaps are equal.
\li The notations NamedNodeMaps are equal.

On the other hand, the following do not affect equality: the ownerDocument, baseURI, and parentNode attributes, the specified attribute for Attr nodes, the schemaTypeInfo attribute for Attr and Element nodes, the Text::isElementContentWhitespace attribute for Text nodes, as well as any user data or event listeners registered on the nodes.

\note As a general rule, anything not mentioned in the description above is not significant in consideration of equality checking.
Note that future versions of this specification may take into account more attributes and implementations conform to this specification are expected to be updated accordingly.
